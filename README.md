ChristmasKrampus
================
Basically, it is an advirtisement for an upcoming graphic novel that I am working on with a good friend, John Gray. 
It is called, "The Christmas Krampus," and it is about the "anti-Santa" or the Krampus. 
The Krampus takes the bad children from their homes on Christmas morning and puts them to work in 
his coal mines. At the top of the site there is a countdown to the release date of the novel and the 
rest of the site below is a "living" Krampus mine. The children all walk around independent of eachother, 
wait their turns for the elevators and make decisions where they want to go and where they want to mine. 
It isn't a looping video or gif, but a system of Javascript Animations and Objects.
